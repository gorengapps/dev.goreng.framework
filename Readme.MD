 # The Framework

The framework consists of various elements to make your Unity life a bit easier. 
If you try to fight the framework you will have a hard time. 
But extending it is quite easy.

## Features

- **Dependency Injection**: Simple and powerful DI system for Unity
- **Scene Management**: Easy-to-use scene loading and management with Addressables
- **View System**: Clean separation between UI logic and business logic
- **Editor Integration**: Automated scene configuration and improved workflows
- **Interface Serialization**: Support for serializing interfaces with `IRef<T>`

## Documentation

- [Dependency Injection](/Documentation/Dependency%20Injection.md)
- [Scene Management](/Documentation/Scene%20Management.md)
## Requirements

- Unity 2022.3.x LTS
## Installation

### Package Manager Installation

1. Open Unity's Package Manager (`Window > Package Manager`)
2. Click the `+` button and select `Add package from git URL...`
3. Enter the Git URL: `https://github.com/gorengapps/dev.goreng.framework.git`

### Scoped Registry Installation (Recommended)

Add a new "Scoped Registry" to your package manager:

1. Open your project's `Packages/manifest.json` file
2. Add the following to the `scopedRegistries` array:

```json
{
  "name": "Goreng Packages",
  "url": "https://packages.goreng.dev",
  "scopes": ["dev.goreng"]
}
```

3. The Framework package should now appear in your Package Manager under "My Registries"
4. You can use the scope `dev.goreng` to find all related packages
## Change-log
### 1.5.1
 - Updated documentation to reflect current API
 - Renamed `ICanvas` to `IView` for better clarity

 - Updated method signatures to use `Awaitable` instead of `Task` for better Unity integration
 - Improved editor tooling and scene management
### 0.2.5
 - Added a custom editor window for `AsyncScene` this allows us to automate some critical configuration that was easy to miss.
	 - Automatically update the label
	 - Automatically update the scene name to reflect the filename
	 - Automatically update the addressable path on rename

 - Fixed a bug that existed in `Tools/Force Service Scene` that didn't apply the force correctly on editor restarts.
 - Update documentation
 - Add `IRef` class to allow for interface serialization.
### 0.2.4
 - Update styling
### 0.2.3
- Removed `MonoBehaviour` from `NavigationService` and `DataService` please use class injection to make them available to your project
- Added IRunLoop which allow you to give non `MonoBehaviours` coroutine logic and update loops
- AbstractBootstrap now has a default `NavigationService` this was done since navigation service is essential.
- Added a `[FetchView]` attribute allowing to prefetch the view automagically
- Added a menu `Tools/Force Service Scene` This allows you to force the Services scene to start when pressing play.
